# intelligentHubCommand
When in a world that is not the "hub" world for that server `/hub` teleports you to the hub world ("world").
When in the "hub" world and the command is run, you get teleported to the main "hub" server (through Bungeecord).
**Command aliases:** /hub, /lobby, /l

That's all there is to the plugin. Its literally like 10 lines of code.

This plugin probably isn't of any use to you. Its built for a very specific purpose for a very specific server (up-and-coming ArtichokeMC).
